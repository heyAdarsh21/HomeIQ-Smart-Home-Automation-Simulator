Smart Home Simulator Website – Full Structure & Features
1. Landing Page (Home Page)
    This is the first impression for users. It should clearly explain what your simulator does and why it’s unique.
    Hero section with tagline -> “Make Your House Smarter, Safer, and Simulated”
    Interactive mockup (a small animation of devices turning ON/OFF)
    Features overview -> Energy monitoring, automation rules, security alerts
    Call to action (button to Launch Simulator)
    Dark/Light mode toggle

2. Core Simulator Dashboard
    This is the heart of your website – where users actually "control" their smart home.
    Key Features:
    Device Control Cards:
     Lights, AC, Locks, Security Cameras, Smart Plugs, etc.
     Each with ON/OFF, slider (brightness/temp), and energy usage.
    Scenes / Modes:
     Predefined: Movie Night, Sleep Mode, Party Mode
     Custom: Users create their own.
    Energy Monitoring Panel:
     Daily/weekly/monthly consumption.
     Graphs & breakdown (by device).
    Alerts Panel:
     Security notifications (door unlocked, smoke, motion).
     Status feed of latest actions.

3. Automation Rules (IFTTT-style)
    This is what makes your simulator unique & realistic.
    Rule builder -> If [Condition], Then [Action]
    Example: If Temp > 30°C, Turn ON AC
    Example: If Door is unlocked after 10 PM, Send Alert
    Show rules in a list with toggles
    Option to simulate a rule instantly

4. Simulation Mode (Day-in-the-Life)
    Here users can watch their home behave automatically like in real life.
    Timeline (Morning -> Afternoon -> Evening -> Night)
    Devices switch ON/OFF automatically based on schedule
    User sees events appear in activity logs

5. Logs & Analytics
    Activity logs -> "Light ON in Living Room at 7:00 PM"
    Energy usage reports
    Alerts history (who unlocked the door, etc.)
    Download/export option (CSV/PDF) -> Python pandas can generate this

6. Settings & Customization
    User profile -> Avatar, username, preferences
    Theme -> Dark/Light/Custom colors
    Device setup -> Add/remove devices, rename rooms, assign icons
    Data reset/clear option

7. (Optional but Cool) Add-ons
    Voice Control (Simulated) → Say "Turn on lights" and UI responds (can be simulated with Python speech recognition).
    AI Recommendations → Suggest rules like “Your AC runs 8 hours daily, set auto-off after 6 hours?”
    Remote Access Simulation → Pretend you’re controlling your smart home from outside.

# Tech Stack to Achieve This
    Frontend
     HTML + CSS + JavaScript (with Tailwind later if you want)
     Chart.js for graphs
     LocalStorage for quick data saving

    Backend (Python)
     Flask or Django -> to manage devices, users, rules
     SQLite/PostgreSQL -> for persistent data
     Pandas/Matplotlib -> for analytics, reports

    Extra Libraries
     schedule or apscheduler -> automation timing
     smtplib -> for email alerts (optional)
     speechrecognition + pyttsx3 -> for voice control (optional)

# Phase 1 – Project Setup
--> Goal: Professional repo structure, clean boilerplate.

* Setup PostgreSQL (local with pgAdmin or cloud like Supabase).
* Flask/FastAPI backend with DB connection.
* React frontend with Tailwind.
==> Deliverable: Backend + frontend both spin up.

# Phase 2 – Backend APIs (Python + PostgreSQL)
--> Goal: Expose REST APIs for devices, rules, logs.
* POST /devices: add device
* GET /devices: list devices
* POST /rules: add automation rule
* GET /rules: list rules
* GET /logs: fetch logs
* Use SQLAlchemy/psycopg2 to handle queries.
==> Deliverable: Fully working CRUD backend tested with Postman.

# Phase 3 – Frontend UI/UX
--> Goal: Professional dashboard using React + Tailwind.
* Sidebar navigation: Dashboard | Devices | Rules | Logs
* Devices page: Add/list devices
* Rules page: Rule builder (IF condition, THEN action)
* Logs page: Real-time event logs (start with polling, later WebSockets).
==> Deliverable: Clickable, clean UI fetching data from backend.

# Phase 4 – Real-Time Features
--> Goal: Add life to the simulator.
* Use WebSockets (Flask-SocketIO or FastAPI WebSockets) for instant device/rule updates.
* Logs update in real-time when rules trigger.
* Device states toggle live (light ON/OFF).
==> Deliverable: Real-time dashboard.

# Phase 5 – Professional Polish
* Authentication (JWT, user profiles).
* Responsive, dark mode.
* Dockerize backend + DB.
* Deploy (frontend on Vercel, backend on Render, DB on Supabase).
* Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI for backend, README with diagrams).
==> Deliverable: Portfolio-ready project.

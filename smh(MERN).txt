# Phase 1 – Project Setup
--> Goal: Lay down the project structure with MERN.
* Create backend server (Node.js + Express).
* Connect with MongoDB (Atlas cloud DB).
* Setup React frontend with Vite/CRA + TailwindCSS/Material UI.
* Organize repo professionally (/client, /server, README.md, .env).
==> Deliverable: A boilerplate MERN app that runs end-to-end.

# Phase 2 – UI/UX Foundations
--> Goal: Create a professional, scalable frontend design.
* Use TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui (modern, minimal, industry standard).
* Build core pages/components:
* Dashboard (devices overview)
* Devices page (list, add, delete)
* Rules page (create, view rules)
* Logs page (real-time logs)
* Apply grid-based layout, navbar, sidebar for pro feel.
==> Deliverable: Clickable frontend with mock data. Looks top-class even without backend logic.

# Phase 3 – API & Data Flow
--> Goal: Connect backend and frontend.
* Build REST APIs:
* POST /devices: Add device
* GET /devices: List devices
* POST /rules: Add rule
* GET /rules: Fetch rules
* Connect React frontend with Axios/Fetch to APIs.
* Store rules/devices in MongoDB.
==> Deliverable: Real data flows between frontend <-> backend <-> database.

# Phase 4 – Real-Time Interactions
--> Goal: Make it behave like a true smart-home simulator.
* Add WebSockets (Socket.io) for live logs + device updates.
* UI instantly updates when rules are triggered.
* Design device state cards (lights toggle ON/OFF in UI).
* Create a rule builder UI (drag/drop or simple form).
==> Deliverable: A working prototype with automation rules triggering UI changes in real time.

# Phase 5 – Professional Polish
--> Goal: Industry-level finish.
* Authentication (JWT, bcrypt, user profiles).
* Dark mode + responsive design.
* Clean code practices (folder structures, reusable components).
* Documentation (README, API docs with Swagger/Postman).
* Deployment (Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Heroku for backend, MongoDB Atlas).
==> Deliverable: Deployed Smart Home Simulator with polished UI/UX.
